          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are
            the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification
            efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with
            information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match
            the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may
            contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have
            previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>

          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity
            or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting
            additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot
            verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that
            you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for
            security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided
            information as soon as we finish verifying you.

            <li>
              You can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf.
